        The James Joyce Tower and Museum is a Martello tower in Sandycove, Dublin, where James Joyce spent six nights in
        1904.
        The opening scenes of his novel Ulysses take place here, and the tower is a place of pilgrimage for Joyce
        enthusiasts, especially on Bloomsday. Admission is free.
        The tower was leased from the British War Office by Joyce's university friend Oliver St. John Gogarty, with the
        purpose of "Hellenising" Ireland.
        Joyce stayed there for six days,
        from September 9 to 14 in 1904. Gogarty later attributed Joyce's abrupt departure to a midnight incident with a
        loaded revolver.[3]

        The opening scenes of Ulysses are set the morning after this incident. Gogarty is immortalised as "Stately,
        plump Buck Mulligan" (the opening words of the novel).

        The tower now contains a museum dedicated to Joyce and displays some of his possessions and other ephemera
        associated with Ulysses (e.g., an empty pot of "Plumtree's Potted Meat"). The living space is set up to resemble
        its 1904 appearance, and contains a ceramic panther to represent one seen in a dream by a resident. It is a
        place of pilgrimage for Joyce enthusiasts, especially on Bloomsday.

        The Tower became a museum opening on 16 June 1962 through the efforts of Dublin artist John Ryan. Ryan also
        rescued the front door to 7 Eccles Street
        (now at the James Joyce Centre) from demolition and organised, with Brian O'Nolan, the first Bloomsday
        Celebration in 1954.

        Dalkey Castle is one of the eight fortified town houses/castles of Dalkey.
        The castles were built to store the goods which were off-loaded in Dalkey during the Middle Ages,
        when Dalkey acted as the port for Dublin. The castles all had defensive features to protect the goods from being
        plundered.
        These are all still visible on the site: the Machicolation, the Murder Hole, the Battlements with its Warders’
        Walk, and slit arrow-loop windows.
        In Dalkey Castle, you will see a fine example of barrel-vaulted ceiling and traces of the wicker work that
        supported it.
        Many niches have been exposed on the walls where precious goods may have been stored.
        The Castle is an integral entrance to both the Heritage Centre and Dalkey Town Hall.

        Ireland’s National Maritime Museum is housed in Dun Laoghaire’s 180-year-old Mariners Church, directly opposite
        the new DLR Lexicon library and
        easily accessible by DART suburban train and several bus services. The museum’s greatest artefact is probably
        the building itself as it is one
        of a few custom built places of worship for seafarers remaining intact in the world to-day.

        Experienced guides will bring you on a voyage of discovery, enthralling you with stories of discovery, heroism,
        war and disasters at sea.
        You will learn about maritime history, exploration, navigation, radio, deep-sea cable technology, nature,
        wildlife and view art inspired by the sea.

        See the 10-tonne revolving Baily Optic, immortalised in James Joyce’s Ulysses, try the electrified steam engine
        and pause to reflect at the Titanic exhibit,
        the re-created radio room, the Royal Navy prisoners docks and the war memorial. Try sailor’s knots, learn how
        they lift heavy weights, be photographed with the pirate,
        research in the library, visit the shop and much more including Humanist and Civil Weddings.
